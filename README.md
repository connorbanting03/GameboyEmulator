# Game Boy Emulator Project

## Overview
This Game Boy emulator is a personal project born out of a lifelong enthusiasm for Nintendo products. As a dedicated fan, I'm developing this emulator to relive the classic Pok√©mon games and other favorite titles from the Game Boy era on modern hardware.

## Game Boy Architecture
### CPU
The Game Boy's CPU is a custom Sharp LR35902 chip, similar to the Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80. It handles:
- Executing game instructions
- Managing memory operations
- Processing interrupts from I/O devices
- Maintaining internal registers

### Memory
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Volatile memory used by the CPU to store and retrieve data during operation.
- **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**: Non-volatile memory that contains the Game Boy's firmware and game data.


## Getting Started
### Project is still under development
